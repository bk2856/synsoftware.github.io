            Document<BR></STRONG>Synergy has been providing Internet strategy 
            analysis services for various organizations. The project typically 
            involves market analysis, analysis of strengths and weaknesses, 
            analysis of technology options, and then creating the document 
            detailing the best approach to creating the Internet presence. The 
            document may detail the site specification, development 
            methodology and the technology platform definitions.</FONT></P>

            size=2><STRONG>System design/Site Development</STRONG><br>Synergy 
            can design and develop your site. Our strengths lie in the back-end 
            integration and engines. Our association with creative graphic 
            artists and designers play a helping role in developing the 
            storefront. The back-ends using involved transaction processing, 
            security, multi-tier architecture, MVC designs, Request-response 
            schemes, caching and architectures involving J2EE and EJB are used 
            by Synergy in several systems such as shipvia.com, payvia.com 
            etc.,.</FONT></P>

            size=2><STRONG>Content Development/Distribution</STRONG><br>Delivering content over the Internet is one of the areas of 
            our specialty. Content whether it is an e-mail,&nbsp; a catalog, an 
            order acknowledgement, a planning document, an ASN, a BOL&nbsp;, a 
            survey or a&nbsp;structured business process - Synergy has the 
            frameworks to get it across using &nbsp;different protocols and 
            exchanges. Synergy's Document Exchange(under development) 
            complements/replaces&nbsp;mail/messaging systems.</P>
            <P align=left><STRONG>Remote Customer Assistance 
            Module&nbsp;</STRONG><br>
            Customer assistance on web is a problem which Synergy 
            is trying to solve. Synergy is developing RCAM (Remote Customer 
            Assist Module) by which a CSR can guide a web-user through the steps, 
            and can actually show how to get the transaction through.</P>
            <P align=left><STRONG>E-Commerce Framework</STRONG><br>
           Synergy's e-commerce frame works include 
            multi-vendor(service provider) and multi-company models. The providing 
            side can have its hierarchy ie. a broker working with several 
            vendors. Similarly the consuming side can have multiple hierarchies - 
            a company having several customers. </P>
            <P align=left>Customization of menus by supplier as well as 
            customer, administrators (customer, supplier and system-wide), 
            security by form, user, and data, common services such 
            as&nbsp;print,&nbsp;core tables, and processes such as backup, log, 
            archive, journal analyze etc are part of the framework. </P>
            <P align=left>The request-response model allows to work with on-line 
            exchanges, batch and legacy systems and&nbsp;web users. XML 
            structures&nbsp;and MVC designs ensure device independence and 
            scalability.</P>
